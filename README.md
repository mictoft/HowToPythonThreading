# Python Threading Learning App

A comprehensive collection of **Python threading examples**, designed to teach every major concept through clear, runnable, well-commented code.

This project covers:

- `threading.Thread` basics  
- Locking primitives (Lock, RLock, Semaphore, Event, Condition, Barrier)  
- Producer/consumer, worker pools, pipelines  
- Thread cancellation and shutdown patterns  
- Race conditions, deadlocks, debugging and profiling  
- Futures and `ThreadPoolExecutor`  
- Interaction with `asyncio`  
- POSIX signals and how they interact with threads  
- Pure-Python “signals & slots” (observer pattern)  
- Qt QThread + signals/slots (optional GUI example)

The goal is to help you *understand Python threading deeply* by running practical examples you can modify and experiment with.
